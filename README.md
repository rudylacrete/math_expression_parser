# Purpose

The purpose of this code was just to challenge myself to implement quickly a simple recursive parser to evaluate math expression following basics rules concerning parenthesis and operators.

The module itself is quite useless as expressions parsed by the code can be evaluated natively by the javascript language. But special function parsing can be added to use usual functions inline without having to use `Math.*` ...

This code also demonstrate a basic usage of object polymorphism and the composite design pattern.$
Though, the code can be improved (float not managed, spaces around numbers also, errors are not always managed ...)
